Oh pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over they wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife 
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quartered by the hands of war
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
Then Caesar's spirit, raging with revenge
