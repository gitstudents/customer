I met a traveler from an antique land
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert near them on the sand
Near them on the sand, half buried A shattered visage lies
Whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
And on the pedastal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandius, King of kings
Look on my works, ye might, and despair.'
